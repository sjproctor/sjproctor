### Hi there, I'm Sarah 👋
👩‍💻 I am the Director of Academic Experience at LEARN Academy, a full-stack web development bootcamp headquartered in San Diego, California. We work primarily in React and Ruby on Rails.  
💥 I am passionate about creating a welcoming, inclusive learning space for people making the transition into a career in technology. I hope to inspire students to step outside their comfort zones and embrace personal growth along with learning the fundamentals of development.  
👥 I am an organizer of SD Ruby, a local meetup group for all developers looking to learn about Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and everything else!
